## Project Overview
The AI Deepfake Image Detection project focuses on identifying deepfake images using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a robust tool that can accurately differentiate between real and manipulated images, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Detects whether an image is real or a deepfake.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models to enhance accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Scalability**: The model is designed to handle large image datasets and can be easily extended to video frame analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/roshini8/AI-DEEPFAKE-IMAGE-DETECTION-.git
    cd AI-DEEPFAKE-IMAGE-DETECTION-
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:


## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Ensure your dataset is properly structured with separate directories for real and fake images.
    - Update the dataset paths in your configuration files or scripts.

2. Start training:
    ```bash
    python training.py --config config.yaml
    ```

### Running Inference
1. Detect deepfake in a single image:
    ```bash
     streamlit ---your path/app.py
    ```


### Visualization
- Visualize model predictions:
    ```bash
    python model Training.ipynb 
    ```

## Dataset
The project can be trained using various deepfake datasets, such as:
- **FaceForensics++**: A dataset of manipulated images using different techniques.
- **Celeb-DF**: A challenging deepfake dataset with high-quality images.
- **DFDC**: A dataset from the DeepFake Detection Challenge by Facebook.

Ensure proper licensing and permissions are in place before using these datasets.

## Model Architecture
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. It leverages pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet, fine-tuned on deepfake image datasets.

Key components include:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes and normalizes images for input into the network.
- **CNN Backbone**: Extracts features from images using a pre-trained model.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies the image as real or fake based on extracted features.
- **Softmax/Logistic Output**: Outputs the probability of the image being a deepfake.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified images.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive deepfake detections to the total detected as deepfakes.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive deepfake detections to all actual deepfakes.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, suitable for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Results
The model has been evaluated on a test set with the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: [99%]
- **Precision**: [99%]
- **Recall**: [100%]
- **F1 Score**: [99%]

These metrics demonstrate the model's capability in detecting deepfake images under various conditions.
